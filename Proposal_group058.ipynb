    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "The goal for this project is to come up with and image classification model for road signs to aid computer vision style of self driving or computer vision aided driving. We will be using a data set from Kaggle that will have road signs from Germany with about 180 class labels that will be used as a training set. The trainng set will have about 10K images and testing will have about 50K images. We will implement 4 models and will compare them by using cross validation techniques that was taught in class.  We want our model to classify different road signs and will select the model with the best accuracy on a testing set. Accuracy testing will be done by comparing the meta data file that was given."

    "Self driving cars are the future of transportation in car centric nations. One of the main problems of self driving cars is dectection and recognition of road signs. There are many shapes and objects that people need to discern when driving and it should not be different for computer vision type of self driving. Computer vision style driving allows self driving cars to know what is around the enviornment. Roadsigns warns the driver the rules of the road and helps keep the road safe for driving. We see lots of things when we are driving and we need to be able to discern the noise from the road signs. It is important for an self driving models to  discern roadsigns so they can follow the rules of the road."
