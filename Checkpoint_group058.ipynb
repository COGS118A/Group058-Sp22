    "The goal for this project is to come up with and image classification model for road signs to aid computer vision style of self driving or computer vision aided driving. We will be using a data set from Kaggle that will have road signs from Germany with about 180 class labels that will be used as a training set. The trainng set will have about 100K images and testing will have about 50K images. We will implement 4 models and will compare them by using cross validation techniques that was taught in class. The four models will be Spectral Cluster, SVM, Residual Neural Network, and Ensemble of CNNs. We want our model to classify different road signs and will select the model with the best accuracy on a testing set. Accuracy testing will be done by comparing the meta data file that was given."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "   Traffic sign classification is an important feature of the self-driving car control pipeline. First the image taken from the camera mounted on the self-driving car requires traffic sign detection, since there may be multiple or no signs within the picture, and state-of-the-art object detection deep neural networks are deployed for this task such as Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, SSD, and YOLO V2.</a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#arcosnote)\n",
    "\n",
    "   After object detection has found and cropped out street signs from the original image from the self-driving car's camera, the cropped street sign images now require traffic sign classification to understand whether or not each street sign seen is a stop sign, a yield sign, etc. Which is very important information the self-driving car needs in order to obey traffic rules and keep its passengers safe.</a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#kakarlanote) The state-of-the-art networks that process this task are Resnet V1 50, Resnet V1 101, Inception V2, Inception Resnet V2, Mobilenet V1, and Darknet-19.</a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#arcosnote)\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Self driving cars are the future of transportation in car centric nations. One of the main problems of self driving cars is dectection and recognition of road signs. There are many shapes and objects that people need to discern when driving and it should not be different for computer vision type of self driving. Computer vision style driving allows self driving cars to know what is around the environment. Roadsigns warns the driver the rules of the road and helps keep the road safe for driving. We see lots of things when we are driving and we need to be able to discern the noise from the road signs. How these road signs are perceived are impacted by things such as the weather(e.g. fog, snow) and the lighting of the area. It is important for an self driving models to discern roadsigns despite the environment so they can follow the rules of the road."

Additionally, the signs on which algorithms are trained on may become outdated resulting in the model failing to identify traffic signs.\n",
