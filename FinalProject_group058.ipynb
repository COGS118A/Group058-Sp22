    "The goal for this project is to come up with and image classification model for road signs to aid computer vision style of self driving or computer vision aided driving. We will be using a data set from Kaggle that will have road signs from Germany with about 180 class labels that will be used as a training set. The trainng set will have about 100K images and testing will have about 50K images. We will be testing the effectiveness and performance of 3 different sizes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with and without Residual Connections. We will implement these models and then will compare them by using cross validation techniques that was taught in class. We want our models to classify different road signs and will select the model with the best accuracy on a testing set. Accuracy testing will be done by comparing the meta data file that was given."

    "Self driving cars are the future of transportation in car centric nations. One of the main problems of self driving cars is dectection and recognition of road signs. There are many shapes and objects that people need to discern when driving and it should not be different for computer vision type of self driving. Computer vision style driving allows self driving cars to know what is around the environment. Roadsigns warns the driver the rules of the road and helps keep the road safe for driving. We see lots of things when we are driving and we need to be able to discern the noise from the road signs. How these road signs are perceived are impacted by things such as the weather(e.g. fog, snow) and the lighting of the area. It is important for an self driving models to discern roadsigns despite the environment so they can follow the rules of the road."

By running 5 different transformations 7 times on each original image, more variety of how these traffic signs are viewed is added to the dataset.
